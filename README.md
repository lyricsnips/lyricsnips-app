# LyricSnips üéµ

A modern web application for lyric enthusiasts to search, discover, and share their favorite song lyrics with beautiful visual snippets.

## Project Introduction

**What is LyricSnips?**
LyricSnips is a comprehensive lyrics discovery and sharing platform that allows users to search for songs, view lyrics, and create beautiful visual snippets to share with others. The application integrates with YouTube to provide song information and offers an AI-powered chat feature for enhanced user interaction.

**Why did I build it?**
I built LyricSnips to solve the common problem of finding and sharing meaningful lyrics in an engaging way. Traditional lyrics websites often lack visual appeal and sharing capabilities.

**Who was it built for?**

- Music enthusiasts who want to discover and share lyrics
- Social media users looking for beautiful lyric snippets to share
- Developers and designers interested in modern web applications
- Anyone who appreciates the intersection of music and technology
